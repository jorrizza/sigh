Sigh. A monitoring application.

A sigh is an audible exhalation of air arising from tiredness
or emotion, usually sadness, which itself could be stemming
from feelings of sadness or futility. A sigh can also arise
from positive emotions such as relief. Some people do it just
to cool down organs or suppress emotions.

Why call it this? I don't know. Sigh.

Sigh has been created to replace things like Munin and
eventually Nagios. These things don't scale that well. Not well
enough anyway. If you want to monitor hundreds of servers,
generating the graphs on a single machine after pulling the
measurements from every single box just doesn't make sense.

Why not turn things around? Machines push their data to a
central (very fast, distributed) data store, and a web server
supplies a simple interface to view the measurements. Graphs
can easily be created using HTML5 Canvas, so there's no need
to generate image files anymore.

The final component is a daemon that checks if the measurements
are within predefined bounds. If they exceed, it should notify
the proper authorities.

Simple, isn't it?
